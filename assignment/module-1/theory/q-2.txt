What is Programming?
Ans:-
Programming is the process of writing instructions for a computer to perform specific tasks or solve problems.

Q-What are the key steps involved in the programming process?
Ans:-
1-Problem Analysis: Understand the task and its requirements.
2-Design: Plan the solution using algorithms and structures.
3-Programming: Write the actual code.
4-Testing: Ensure the code works correctly through various tests.
5-Optimization: Improve performance and refactor code.
6-Documentation: Provide clear comments and user guides.
7-Deployment: Make the program available for use.
8-Maintenance: Continuously monitor, fix issues, and update the program.

Q-Types of Programming Languages?
Ans:-
1-Low-Level Languages:

    Machine Language (binary, directly executed by hardware)
    Assembly Language (symbolic code, closer to machine code)
2- High-Level Languages:

    Procedural (e.g., C, Fortran)
    Object-Oriented (e.g., Java, C++)
    Functional (e.g., Haskell, Lisp)
    Declarative (e.g., SQL, Prolog)
    Scripting (e.g., Python, JavaScript)
3-Markup and Query Languages:

    Markup (e.g., HTML, XML)
    Query (e.g., SQL)
4-Domain-Specific Languages (e.g., MATLAB, R, VHDL)

5-Esoteric Languages (e.g., Brainfuck, Malbolge)
