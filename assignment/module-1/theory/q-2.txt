What is Programming?
Ans:-
Programming is the process of writing instructions for a computer to perform specific tasks or solve problems.

Q-What are the key steps involved in the programming process?
Ans:-
1-Problem Analysis: Understand the task and its requirements.
2-Design: Plan the solution using algorithms and structures.
3-Programming: Write the actual code.
4-Testing: Ensure the code works correctly through various tests.
5-Optimization: Improve performance and refactor code.
6-Documentation: Provide clear comments and user guides.
7-Deployment: Make the program available for use.
8-Maintenance: Continuously monitor, fix issues, and update the program.

Q-Types of Programming Languages?
Ans:-
1-Low-Level Languages:

    Machine Language (binary, directly executed by hardware)
    Assembly Language (symbolic code, closer to machine code)
2- High-Level Languages:

    Procedural (e.g., C, Fortran)
    Object-Oriented (e.g., Java, C++)
    Functional (e.g., Haskell, Lisp)
    Declarative (e.g., SQL, Prolog)
    Scripting (e.g., Python, JavaScript)
3-Markup and Query Languages:

    Markup (e.g., HTML, XML)
    Query (e.g., SQL)
4-Domain-Specific Languages (e.g., MATLAB, R, VHDL)

5-Esoteric Languages (e.g., Brainfuck, Malbolge)

Q-What are the main differences between high-level and low-level programminglanguages?
Ans:-
1.	It is programmer friendly language.	                It is a machine friendly language.
2.	High level language is less memory efficient.	    Low level language is high memory efficient.
3.	It is easy to understand.	                        It is tough to understand.
4.	Debugging is easy.	                                Debugging is complex comparatively.
5.	It is simple to maintain.	                        It is complex to maintain comparatively.
6.	It is portable.	                                    It is non-portable.
7.	It can run on any platform.	                        It is machine-dependent.
8.	It needs compiler or interpreter for translation.	It needs assembler for translation.
9.	It is used widely for programming.	                It is not commonly used now-a-days in programming.
