What is a Program?

A program is a sequence of instructions written in the C programming language that tells the computer how to perform a specific task or solve a problem

THEORY EXERCISE: Explain in your own words what a program is and how it functions.

A C program follows a specific process to function, from writing the code to executing it:

1-Writing the Code:

A C program is written using a text editor. The program consists of functions (the main one being main()), variables, and statements that define how the program operates. It also includes logic (like loops and conditions) to process data and make decisions.

2-Compilation:

Once the code is written, it needs to be compiled to convert the human-readable C code into machine code that the computer can execute. This is done by a compiler.
The compiler checks the program for syntax errors (like missing semicolons or incorrect variable types) and then translates the code into a machine-readable format (an executable file).

3-Linking:

After compiling, the linker combines the compiled program with external libraries (such as standard libraries like stdio.h for input/output operations) to form an executable file that can be run on the system.

4-Execution:

When the program is run, the computer's CPU starts executing the instructions. The program begins at the main() function, where the execution starts.
The program carries out actions based on the written code, such as taking inputs, performing calculations, or printing outputs.

5-Input and Output:

A C program often interacts with the user through input and output. Functions like scanf() are used to take input from the user, and printf() is used to display output on the screen.

6-Control Flow:

The program might include decision-making structures (if, else) and loops (for, while) that guide how the instructions are executed based on certain conditions.
This allows the program to repeat tasks or make decisions based on the input or data it processes.
